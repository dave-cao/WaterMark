<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Have you ever wanted to just simply watermark your images before posting them? So did I, however, I saw a lot 
of paid options and thought, man, I could just make this myself. Introducing WaterMark.

How is this different from other programs you may ask? Well, I made it for one :). 

Another powerful feature of this program is that you can Batch Upload your images and the same watermark will
be applied to all of them! This will save you a lot of time if you have a lot of photos you want to watermark.

### Built With

Python3

Packages:
- Tkinter
- Pillow

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you get set up locally. Don't hesitate to message me if you have any problems!

### Prerequisites

- [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- The [python installer package installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/): `pip` (used to install required dependencies)
```sh
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dave-cao/WaterMark.git
```
3. Install pip packages
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. Run the application
```sh
python3 main.py
```

2. You should be met with the following image.
![WaterMark Image](img/image0.png)

3. Upload your logo and / or input your watermark text. Your logo will automatically be scaled to fit to size by default

4. Now upload the image you want to watermark. If it's only a single image then click `Upload Image`. If it's multiple, you can go for the `Batch Upload`.

    - If you go for the `Upload Image` option, you will be presented with a clickable image your upload. Click the image and a preview of your watermark will be presented to you.
        - ![Image preview eg](img/image1.png)
    - If you want to save your watermark, another button should appear at the button. Simply click it and your image will be saved suffixed with `_watermarked`.
        - ![save button](img/image2.png)

5. If you go for the `Batch Upload` option, you will not get image previews. All you have to do is choose all your images, click ok, and wait. You should then get a `Success` message. If you look back inside your folder, a `watermarked/` folder should be present. Inside will be all your watermarked images.

6. Exit application
```
ctl + c
# or click the "x" button.
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Currently there is no future plans for this project. Some future ideas that I had while thinking of this project though:
1. Where it stands, the logo goes on the top left and the text goes on the bottom left. Perhaps in the future I can build an option to change the positions.
2. Only two text colours available, "White" and "Black".
